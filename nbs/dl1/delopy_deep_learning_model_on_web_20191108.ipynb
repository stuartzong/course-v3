I just replaced the model.pkl, classes.txt files with mine. and specified the fastai version i used in the requirements.txt file. New version fastai loads learner a little differently. load_learn(path=, file=) instead of fname=. the pickle file contianing all the model weights needs to be consitent with the file name you used in the app.py script when you load the model.\n",
